Replace this text with the introduction to your story.
Press enter in the dialogue editor to add new lines.

Do not remove the animation player lines unless you do not want the player to walk on and off the scene.
do animation_player.play(&"walk_off")
You can include one line here that shows after the player begins to walk off the screen.
Finally, set the next scene by selecting the Cinematic node under Scene (left panel) and then setting "Next Scene" in the Inspector (right panel). We are going to transition to the next scene now...
